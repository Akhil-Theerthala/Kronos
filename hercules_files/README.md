## Integrating Kronos with Hercules

The future scope for Kronos is using [Hercules](https://github.com/kshitij10496/hercules)'s API-endpoints to retrieve the data on the client side (server side also works fine for now). Advantages are - Single source of data for various projects requiring same data, no JSON (data) files in the project itself.

As of now [@Shankusu993](https://github.com/Shankusu993) has written a script for scrapping results from hercules.

TODO: Change this to obtain data only for queried course during runtime.
